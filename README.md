# Spicify

For our final project we had an open brief so our group decided to make a web app that would read a user's mood from a selfie (by using Azure's facial recognition API) and then create a playlist (using Spotify's API) based on that. The user can play the songs through their browser or save the playlist to their Spotify account if they want.
